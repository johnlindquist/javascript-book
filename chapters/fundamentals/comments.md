# Comments

Before we dive into code, let's first learn how to take notes:

```js
//This is a comment
```

Notice the `//` at the beginning of the line? They tell you that what comes
next isn't code. As you learn new tricks or have questions, go ahead and
add those comments to your code:

```js
//What the heck does this do?
const validate = compose(isOldEnough, hasTicket)
//Maybe those are functions... ðŸ¤“
//Yes, emoji work in comments, so have fun ðŸŽ‰
```

## Multi-line Comments

```js
/*
You can write as many lines as you want in here!
So go ahead and write a short story about a squirrel, I won't mind!
No? Ok, well then just use these to explain more complicated logic
*/
```

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Anything between those
will be considered "not code". Go ahead and write as many comments as you like.
A great way of learning programming is to write about it in plain English.
